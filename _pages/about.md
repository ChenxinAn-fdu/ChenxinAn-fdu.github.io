I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate at HKU, supervised by [Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/). I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees from the Department of Computer Science at Fudan University, advised by Prof. [Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/en.html). My current research focuses on building effective long-context LLMs, including:
(1) Fully utilizing the training context.
(2) Efficient inference on over 1 million tokens.
(3) Developing better evaluation tasks for current long-context LLMs.

    We are thrilled to unveil our latest breakthroughs, <em>POLARIS-7B-Preview</em> and <em>POLARIS-4B-Preview</em>, which mark a new frontier in open‐recipe reasoning models developed using academic‐level resources. 
    <br>
    <em>POLARIS-4B-Preview</em> is fine-tuned from <em>Qwen3-4B</em> and <em>POLARIS-7B-Preview</em> is fine-tuned from <em>Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B</em>.
    <br>
    Our 4B model achieves an impressive <strong>81.2% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24</strong> and <strong>79.4% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME25</strong>, outperforming state-of-the-art commercial models like <em>Claude-4-Opus</em>, <em>Grok-3-Beta</em>, and <em>o3-mini-high(2025/01/31)</em> via scaling reinforcement learning on open-source data. On AIME25, POLARIS astonishingly achieves comparable performance to <em>Qwen3-235B-A22B</em> while using less than <strong>2%</strong> of its parameters and can be deployed on consumer-grade GPUs.
  </p>
  <p>
    To foster progress in scaling RL on advanced reasoning models, we are open-sourcing our dataset, code, and training details for the research community.
